ANTI-STRESS TIP #2: TALK it out. Connecting with others- friends, peers, peer leaders, etc. can help you think through problems while refocusing your energy.
ANTI-STRESS TIP #3: try to get adequate sleep. If you can't, coordinate your sleep schedule with your sleep cycles. See info/brochures at SHAC!
