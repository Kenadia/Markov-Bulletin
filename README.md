All code by Ken Schiller.

Builds trigram language model for each section of Carleton College's Noon News Bulletin (NNB) and generates “likely sentences” based on the model.

Basic instructions for doing something with this:
  - Run markov_bulletin.py while cd'ed into the directory containing it.
  - Wait 30 seconds
  - See what you got in generated/

File descriptions:
  - get_nnb_data.py — Gets nnb page (html) for each day in the 2011-2012 school year, extracts each category and puts it in the right folder in download/, still in html format.
  - parse.py — Parses the html stuff in download/ and saves just the text to parsed/
  - markov_bulletin.py — Reads text in parsed/ and outputs randomly generated NNB entries to generated/

  - download/ — Downloaded html sections by NNB category.
  - parsed/ — NNB text by category and by day.
  - generated/ — Stuff generated by markov_bulletin.py
  - file structure template — If you wanted to re-download or re-parse you would have to have download/ or parse/ set up with the correct subfolders, so this is an empty copy of a folder with the correct subfolders.

  - nnb_data.txt — When I first tried to download the NNB with python, I got this output. I don't know where it comes from but it's huge. I don't know which dates it's from.
  - examples.rtf — Some ones I thought were funny that I got running the generator on nnb_data.txt
