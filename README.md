Builds trigram language model for each section of Carleton College's Noon News Bulletin (NNB) and generates “likely sentences” based on the model.

Basic instructions for doing something with this:
  - Run markov_bulletin.py while cd'ed into the directory containing it.
  - Wait 30 seconds
  - See what you got in generated/

File descriptions:
  -get_nnb_data.py — Gets nnb page (html) for each day in the 2011-2012 school year, extracts each category and puts it in the right folder in download/, still in html format.
  -parse.py — Parses the html stuff in download/ and saves just the text to parsed/
  -markov_bulletin.py — Reads text in parsed/ and outputs randomly generated NNB entries to generated/

  -download/ — Downloaded html sections by NNB category.
  -parsed/ — NNB text by category and by day.
  -generated/ — Stuff generated by markov_bulletin.py
  -file structure template — If you wanted to re-download or re-parse you would have to have download/ or parse/ set up with the correct subfolders, so this is an empty copy of a folder with the correct subfolders.

  -nnb_data.txt — When I first tried to download the NNB with python, I got this output. I don't know where it comes from but it's huge. I don't know which dates it's from.
  -examples.rtf — Some ones I thought were funny that I got running the generator on nnb_data.txt
